# dotfiles

Before doing anything, make sure you know what are you doing! Settings applied by this repository are very personal, and definitely not suite everyones needs. I suggest to create your own set of dotfiles based on this repo.

1. Clone repository to hidden .dotfile directory in your home directory

```git clone git@github.com:pawelgrzybek/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles```

2. Run setup-symlinks.sh

```source ~/.dotfiles/setup-symlinks.sh```

3. Same with setup-macos.sh file

```source ~/.dotfiles/setup-osx.sh```

4. VSCode, iTerm and Alfred settings needs to be symlinked separately.
