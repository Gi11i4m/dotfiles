# dotfiles

Before doing anything, make sure you know what and why you doing that. All these settings that this repo injects on your ecosystem are very personal, and definatelyy not suite everyodys needs. I suggest to create your own set of dotfiles based on this repo.

1. Clone repository to hidden .dotfile directory in your home directory
```git clone git@github.com:studiorgb/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles```
2. Run setup-symlinks.sh
```source ~/.dotfiles/setup-symlinks.sh```
3. Same with setup-osx.sh file
```source ~/.dotfiles/setup-osx.sh```
4. Sublime Text, iTerm and Terminal settings needs to be symlinked separately.
