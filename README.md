# dotfiles

Before doing everything make sure you have a backup of all your dotfiles. Just in case!

1. Clone repository to hidden .dotfile directory in your home
```git clone git@github.com:studiorgb/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles```
2. Run install.sh
```source ~/.dotfiles/setup-symlinks.sh```
3. Same with osx.sh file
```source ~/.dotfiles/setup-osx.sh```
